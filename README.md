This repository serves as a central hub for all teaching materials, curriculum updates, and project resources developed for the expanded CSNeT programme. Contributions and collaborations are welcome to further enhance AI and robotics education for students.

**CSNeT: Enhancing AI and Robotics Education**
**What the Project Does**
The CSNeT (Computer Science Network) programme, hosted by the Au Reikura School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at the University of Waikato, is an after-school initiative designed for Year 9–13 high school students. The programme introduces students to fundamental computing concepts, starting from basic programming and progressing to more advanced AI and computer vision topics.

To enhance student engagement and provide hands-on experience, the programme integrates advanced robotics technologies, including:

- Create 3 Robot – Explores AI applications such as music, memory capacity, and adaptive behaviour using Python-based programming.
- Yanshee Humanoid Robot – Features high-definition cameras, stereo speakers, and advanced sensors, enabling students to learn face and object detection, gesture recognition, and colour detection.
- This project develops a comprehensive set of teaching materials to support these technologies, providing students with engaging, real-world applications of AI and robotics.

**Why the Project Is Useful**
With the rapid advancement of AI and computer vision, it is crucial to equip students with the skills needed for the future of computing. CSNeT fills the gap in computational education by:

- Offering structured learning in programming, AI, and robotics.
- Providing hands-on experience with state-of-the-art robots.
- Encouraging problem-solving, creativity, and collaboration.
- Preparing students for future careers in technology and engineering.
- This project ensures that students remain engaged and inspired by introducing them to emerging computing trends in an interactive and accessible way.
